________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Note:
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how market segmentation typically unfolds. These 10 steps represent the full journeyâ€”from deciding if segmentation is worth it, all the way to refining your strategy after itâ€™s implemented.

1.	Deciding (Not) to Segment
    Evaluate if segmentation is needed at all, based on the diversity of your market, your data capabilities, and internal readiness.
  	   
2.	Identifying the Market
    Define the broad space you want to segmentâ€”this avoids confusion later and makes your process more focused.
  	
3.	Selecting Segmentation Bases
    Choose variables (like demographics, psychographics, behaviour, or geography) that will serve as the foundation for creating segments.
  	
4.	Collecting Data
    Start gathering accurate and relevant data to support your segmentation model.
  	
5.	Developing a Segmentation Model
    Use statistical tools (like clustering) to find actual groupings based on your selected variables.
  	
6.	Profiling the Segments
    Describe each segment in depthâ€”who they are, what they value, and how they act.
  	
7.	Evaluating Segment Attractiveness
    Score each segment using criteria such as size, profit potential, growth rate, and fit with your business.
  	
8.	Selecting Target Segments
    Pick the segment(s) you want to pursue based on attractiveness and internal capability.
  	
9.	Developing a Positioning Strategy
    Craft messaging and marketing strategies specifically for those selected segments.
  	
10.	Monitoring and Reviewing
    Constantly evaluate your segmentation to ensure it still makes senseâ€”and refine when necessary.
